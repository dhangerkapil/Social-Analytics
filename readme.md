## News Mood

In this assignment, you'll create a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets, and to present your findings visually.

Your final output should provide a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by the following news organizations: __BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times__.


The first plot will be and/or feature the following:

* Be a scatter plot of sentiments of the last __100__ tweets sent out by each news organization, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, where a score of 0 expresses a neutral sentiment, -1 the most negative sentiment possible, and +1 the most positive sentiment possible.
* Each plot point will reflect the _compound_ sentiment of a tweet.
* Sort each plot point by its relative timestamp.

The second plot will be a bar plot visualizing the _overall_ sentiments of the last 100 tweets from each organization. For this plot, you will again aggregate the compound sentiments analyzed by VADER.

The tools of the trade you may need for your task as a data analyst include the following: tweepy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and VADER.
